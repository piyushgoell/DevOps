# Agile Software Development.

DevOps grew out of the Agile software development movement.  

The traditional way of doing software development was called **WaterFall**. It is focused on long planning phases and doing several month of software development and then a long testing and release cycle.  

**Agile** seeks to develop software in small, frequent cycles in order to deliver functionality to customers quickly.
