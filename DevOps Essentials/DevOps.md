# What is DevOps ?

**Dev (Development) + Ops (Operations)**  
"DevOps is a software engineering ***culture*** and ***practice*** that aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, more dependable releases, in close alignment with business objectives"

### DevOps is NOT

- DevOps is NOT a **Tool**.
- DevOps is NOT a **Standard**.
- DevOps is NOT a **Product**.
- DevOps is NOT a **Job Title**.

# Agile Software Development

DevOps grew out of the Agile software development movement.  

The traditional way of doing software development was called **WaterFall**. It is focused on long planning phases and doing several month of software development and then a long testing and release cycle.  

**Agile** seeks to develop software in small, frequent cycles in order to deliver functionality to customers quickly.  
Also, It quickly respond to changing business goals.  
It can be difficult to DevOps without Agile and Agile without DevOps.  

In **2007**: Agile software development was gaining popularity, but it was also suffering from a growing divide between development and operations. **Patrick Debois**, an engineer with experience doing both dev and ops saw there are many issues getting in the of releasing software quicky while maintaining stability.

# DevOps Culture

DevOps Culture is about **collaboration** between Dev and Ops.

## Under Traditional Model : 
Development and Operations are considered as two seperate entities having opposing goals.

The goal of the development team is to deliver features into the hands of the customer as quickly as possible i.e **Speed** but the goal of the operations team is to maintain the **Stability** of the system and minimize **downtime**.  

These two goals ends up becoming opposition to one another, because one of the worst things for stability is changes. Everytime you change the system you introduced the instability.

The development team is always deploying changes and not really prioritizing stability while the operations team is trying to slow down the development team in order to amintain stability.

**Both Speed and Stability are very important goals**, but the above opposition compromises both of these goals to some degree.


## Under DevOps Culture : 

It is about **collaboration** between Dev and Ops.
They both share the same goal and prioritize speed and stability equally.

### Goals

- Fast time-to-market(TTM).
- Few production failures.
- Immediate recovery from failures.
